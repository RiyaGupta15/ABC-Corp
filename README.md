## Problem Statement


This dashboard enables the corporation to analyze its sales performance and customer-related insights across key product categoriesâ€”Office Supplies, Furniture, and Technology. It offers a breakdown of sales by sub-category and country, allowing the business to identify which products and markets are performing well and which may require strategic attention.

The quantity sold by region helps highlight demand patterns across different areas, supporting targeted distribution and inventory planning. A detailed customer-level view showing individual sales, cost, and profit figures allows for granular analysis and identification of high-value or underperforming accounts.

Trends in total orders over years and quarters provide a clear picture of business growth and seasonality, while the order date slicer and shipment mode filter enable flexible, in-depth exploration of data. KPIs such as total sales, cost, and profit present a quick snapshot of overall business performance, helping leadership track financial health at a glance.

By using this dashboard, the corporation can make data-driven decisions to boost profitability, streamline operations, and strengthen customer relationships across regions and product lines.
